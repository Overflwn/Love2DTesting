## A crappy extended version of [url=http://osmstudios.com/tutorials/your-first-love2d-game-in-200-lines-part-1-of-3]this[/url]
# What I added / fixed:
1. Score and HP display at the top left
2. Fixed enemy spawns (they spawned outside of the screen)
3. Added in HP
4. Enemy bullets do damage to your HP (-5 each)
5. Enemies spawn bullets
6. Fixed enemy spawns again (they just popped in at the top)
7. Fixed death screen (player could continue shooting and moving invisible)
8. Added in a hit "animation" (the player blinks up white for a short time)
9. (Maybe later: sound effects and some music)
10. (Maybe later: set difficulty)
